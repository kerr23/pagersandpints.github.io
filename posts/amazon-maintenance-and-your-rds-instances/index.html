    <p>I recently had the pleasure of Amazon telling me that they had to reboot all of my Postgres RDS instances to apply some security patches.</p>

<p>When using RDS you generally expect that Amazon is going to do something like this and I was at least happy that they told me about it and gave me the option to trigger it on a specific maintenance window or else on my own time (up to a drop dead date where they&rsquo;d just do it for me)</p>

<p>One thing that you can&rsquo;t really know is what the impact of the operation is going to be. You know it&rsquo;s a downtime, but for how long?</p>

<p>My production instances, are of course, Multi-AZ but all of my non-production instances are not.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my non-production instances and my production instances both needed to get rebooted, so I could do some  up-front testing on the timing.</p>

<p>What I found was that the process takes about 10 to 15 minutes and, in this particular case, it was not impacted by database size.<br />
Although it is impacted by the number of instances you&rsquo;re rebooting at the same time. It seems Amazon queues the instances up so that some instances take longer than others.</p>

<p>The pre-reboot security patches took about 5 minutes to load during this time the database was up.<br />
This was followed by a shutdown / reboot during which the database was unavailable.<br />
After the reboot which took less than a minute the database was immediately available while the system did post processing.<br />
After that a backup is performed which doesn&rsquo;t impact the system.</p>

<p>So total downtime was about a minute, but I scheduled 10 minutes just to be safe.</p>

<p>For the Multi-AZ instances the same process is followed but the shutdown / reboot is accompanied by an AZ failover which takes place nearly instantly. This is pretty cool as long as your applications are robust enough to re-connect. (Mine were not, so they required a restart) I timed the reboot to go with a deploy so no additional downtime was required.</p>

<p>In the end it was fairly painless, if you don&rsquo;t trust your applications ability to reconnect it&rsquo;s good to baby sit them. Otherwise kicking it off during a maintenance window and not worrying about it is certainly doable.</p>
