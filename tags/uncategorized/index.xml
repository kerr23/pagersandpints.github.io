      <description>I recently submitted a (very) small patch for PostgreSQL to fix a problem we were having with the backup label not getting fsynced to disk. (which is a problem if you&amp;rsquo;re using something like AWS or SAN snapshots.)
Â I kindly got a mention in the release notes for it, pretty cool! (thanks guys!)</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m toying around with pg_service.conf. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious - but I was able to determine that if you add pg_service.conf to /etc/sysconfig/pgsql/ it will get picked up globally.</description>

      <title>How To Fix Stalled CUPS Printing</title>

      <description>Every once in a while CUPS printing just stalls, no reason that I can tell. (I blame the network, naturally) but what ends up happening is that the print jobs get backed up and you need to clear out the queue. The fastest way to do this is to do:
rm /var/spool/cups/*
/etc/init.d/cups restart</description>
