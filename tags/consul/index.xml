      <description>Through the history of technology, configuration management has driven many design patterns. Empires have been built upon things such as Chef, Ansible, or Puppet all with the intent to remove barriers in managing configuration files for applications deployed in various places. One of the challenges with the traditional approach is the people who understand the configuration(the QA team, developers etc.) are usually different from the people who are managing the configs in Chef.</description>
