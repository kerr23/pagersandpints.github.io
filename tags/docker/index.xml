      <description>Through the history of technology, configuration management has driven many design patterns. Empires have been built upon things such as Chef, Ansible, or Puppet all with the intent to remove barriers in managing configuration files for applications deployed in various places. One of the challenges with the traditional approach is the people who understand the configuration(the QA team, developers etc.) are usually different from the people who are managing the configs in Chef.</description>

      <description>I was working with a friend of mine on his startup Down For Whatever and he wanted to use Docker.
I created a docker farm for him and we&#39;re using Centurion for deployments, we signed up for a docker hub account to store images and started pushing code.
A few days later he emailed me saying that he wanted to switch to capistrano for code deployments instead of building a docker image each time because pushing the image to docker hub took too damn long.</description>
