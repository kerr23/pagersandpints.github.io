      <description>I was working with a friend of mine on his startup Down For Whatever and he wanted to use Docker.
I created a docker farm for him and we&amp;rsquo;re using Centurion for deployments, we signed up for a docker hub account to store images and started pushing code.
A few days later he emailed me saying that he wanted to switch to capistrano for code deployments instead of building a docker image each time because pushing the image to docker hub took too damn long.</description>
