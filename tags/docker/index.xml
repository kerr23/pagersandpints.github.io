      <description>I was working with a friend of mine on his startup Down For Whatever and he wanted to use Docker.
I created a docker farm for him and we&amp;rsquo;re using Centurion for deployments, we signed up for a docker hub account to store images and started pushing code.
A few days later he emailed me saying that he wanted to switch to capistrano for code deployments instead of building a docker image each time because pushing the image to docker hub took too damn long.</description>

      <description>While preparing my presentation on Postgres and Docker to the PDX Postgres User Group for the June meeting, I thought it would be cool to run Postgres on Docker through some rough benchmarks. What I ended up finding was fairly surprising.
The Setup For this test I used Digital Ocean&amp;rsquo;s smallest droplet 512M RAM/1 CPU/20G SSD Disks.
They have an awesome feature where you can chose the type of application you want to run on the droplet and they&amp;rsquo;ll pre-configure it for you.</description>
